# Launch roadmap V1

16 Oct 2026. How Titan117 gets from zero to launch. V1 is the whole product in [the feature map](notes/brainstorming-feature-map.md) (decisions §1); the work is split into 19 phases (0 to 18). Each phase has a **check that marks it done**; the next phase starts only when it passes. Status lives in [progress.md](progress.md). Where this file and [decisions.md](notes/decisions.md) disagree, decisions.md wins.

## Goal and quality bar

- **Launch when the whole product works well,** not earlier. No public release before phase 18.
- **Local-first:** agents run on the user's laptop; our cloud only does accounts, plans, credits, devices and what users choose to share.
- **Every phase meets the guardrails:** typecheck, lint, tests and build pass; refusals are tested; it was seen working in the real app; `progress.md` is updated.
- **Repos:** `titan117-web` (web app, Convex, shared package) and `titan117-desktop` (Electron shell, engine, agents). A phase names which repo it touches.

## Phases

| # | Phase | Repo | Depends on | Done when |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 0 | Setup | both | — | Both repos build in CI; an empty app builds and runs locally on Windows |
| 1 | Engine core | desktop | 0 | Chat with a local and an OpenRouter model works; a tool call waits for approval; denial tests pass |
| 2 | Accounts and money | web, desktop | 0 | A test purchase adds credits; a task deducts them; an API key in the keychain works; an ended subscription locks the app |
| 3 | Titan and memory | desktop | 1 | Titan finishes 10 scripted everyday tasks; the prompt-injection suite passes |
| 4 | Web search and artifacts | desktop, web | 3 | A research task produces a sourced report that downloads as PDF, Word and Excel, and shares by link |
| 5 | Install and setup | desktop | 1 | A fresh Windows and Mac go from download to first task with no manual installs; with the network off, local work runs for 14 days, then the app locks |
| 6 | Folder agent | desktop | 3 | Answers on a real test set of documents cite the right file and page |
| 7 | Coding engine and code builder | desktop | 3 | The code builder fixes a set of real issues in a sample repo and opens a pull request |
| 8 | App builder: web | desktop | 7 | Five sample web apps build, pass their tests and publish |
| 9 | App builder: mobile and desktop | desktop | 8 | A sample app runs on the Android emulator and a phone; a desktop app installs on a clean VM |
| 10 | Sidebar apps | desktop | 8 | A CRM and an inventory app share data, and Titan answers across both |
| 11 | Agent builder | desktop | 3 | A user creates an agent in the form; a manager agent splits a task between two agents |
| 12 | QA and SEO agents | desktop | 8 | Both run end to end on a real site, and their reports download |
| 13 | Automation | desktop | 3 | A recorded task replays on a schedule; the law watcher reports a real change |
| 14 | Marketing and video | desktop | 4, 12 | A website turns into a promo video and a month of posts scheduled on two platforms |
| 15 | Remote and channels | web, desktop | 2, 3 | A task started from the phone runs on the laptop and is approved from chat |
| 16 | Marketplace | web, desktop | 11 | A community agent and an app template install safely from GitHub |
| 17 | Teams and plans | web, desktop | 2 | A team of three shares agents and apps with roles enforced |
| 18 | Beta and launch | both | all | Beta issues fixed; the launch checklist passes |

**Order logic:** 1–5 are the foundation every agent needs. 6–8 give the first agents we can use ourselves (internal dogfooding starts after 8). From 9 on, phases can overlap where their dependencies allow, since most are new agents and tools on the same engine.

## Risks and open decisions

| Risk | Mitigation |
|---|---|
| Scope: everything in V1 is a very large build | Strict phase checks; internal use from phase 8 on to find problems early; cut-or-delay decisions recorded in decisions.md |
| Local models too weak on ordinary laptops | Hardware check, OpenRouter fallback with cost shown, test sets per agent |
| Coding engine (OpenCode) API changes | Pin versions, wrap it behind our own interface, compatibility tests |
| Platform rules: app stores, social APIs, Google | Start API reviews early (phase 14 needs approvals months ahead) |
| Signing and notarization delays | Buy the Apple and Windows signing accounts well before the first external testers (decisions §16) |
| Trademark: "Titan117" and the avatar logo | Trademark check and our own restyled avatar before beta |
| Prompt injection and unsafe actions | Guardrails §4–§5, approval layer, injection suite in CI |

Open decisions before phase 0 are listed in [decisions.md](notes/decisions.md#open-decisions).
